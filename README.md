# Wait For (an Element) jQuery Plugin

You need this plugin if you are trying to do something AFTER a certain element has appeared on the page, such as when you are creating elements via Javascript.  If you're using another library that does not fire a callback when the element appears, you can use this plugin to know when that element is ready on the page to do further processing.

See `jquery.wait_for.js` for usage info
